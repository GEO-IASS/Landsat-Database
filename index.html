<p>This is a database manager to help organize Curtis Woodcock's remote sensing group at Boston University. The group has recently been analyzing time series models developed using entire Landsat image stacks to look at landcover change. The model used for analysis is termed CCDC (Continuous Change Detection and Classification) and was developed by Zhe Zhu and Curtis Woodcock (Zhu and Woodcock 2014). Recently, it has been used as a strong influence in the development of another model, YATSM (Yet Another Time Series Model), by Chris Holden. The original CCDC is written in MATLAB, while YATSM is being developed in Python.</p>

<p>This page is meant to help organize the research at BU that utilizes the two time series models. Information on the scenes run can be found in the two data tables, CCDC_Scenes.csv and YATSM_Scenes.csv, as well as basic information on all scenes in All_Scenes.csv. In addition, the information is visualized on a map, PRmap.geojson. The map is color coded based on whether it was run by CCDC, YATSM, or both.</p>
